In this directory you will find a series of inputs and outputs from
the jedi model. The directory also includes a bash script to load some
required modules.
If you are running on spartan you execute this with
. modules.sh
There is also a skeleton python script "read_script.py" to read the required
variables and a demonstration of how to form annual means from these.
